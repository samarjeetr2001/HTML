	             	<h3>1. JAWA </h3>
	             	The Jawa Forty Two is the entry-level model in the resurrected brand's motorcycle range. The Forty Two offers a slightly different flavour, in ergonomics and colour options, but it shares the same engine, chassis, and cycle parts with the slightly more expensive Jawa. What the Forty Two offers is a slightly more youthful take on the legendary Jawa name, so it gets six colour options, which includes some nice matte finish paint jobs as well. So, at ₹ 1.55 lakh (ex-showroom), the Jawa Forty Two may be the less expensive model, but it's targeted more at attracting Jawa purists with its attractive colours and slightly more contemporary feel. But make no mistake, the silhouette is still classic Jawa.<br>

	              	<h3>2. BENELLI:IMPERIALE 400</h3>
	              	The Benelli Imperiale 400 is powered by a 374 cc, single-cylinder, air-cooled, four-valve, fuel-injected engine, which puts out 20.7 bhp at 5,500 rpm, and peak torque of 29 Nm at 4,500 rpm. It may be an air-cooled single-cylinder, but the engine will not shy away from being revved and purrs straight to the 6,000 rpm redline, without feeling strained, or out of breath. It's not quick by any standards, but the Imperiale 400 will hold respectable highway speeds, if you're the kind who's into long distance riding.<strong> Price (Ex-showroom)	₹ 1.69 Lakh</strong><br>
